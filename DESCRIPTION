Title: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data
Version: 1.1.4
Author: Paul Walter
Maintainer: Paul Walter <paul.w@gmx.net>
Description: Functions that provide statistical methods for interval-censored (grouped) data. The package supports the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression models with interval-censored dependent variables. Parameter estimates are obtained by a stochastic expectation maximization algorithm. Furthermore, the package enables the direct (without covariates) estimation of statistical indicators from interval-censored data via an iterative kernel density algorithm. Survey and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) weights can be included into the direct estimation (see, Walter, P. (2019) <doi:10.17169/refubium-1621>).
